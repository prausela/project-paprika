# Bad Blood Feud

Two vampiresses sisters decide to settle their sibling-rivalry by challenging each other to dancing at the rhythm of underworld famous DJ Memento Mori. One player will play the role of Nina, a white-haired happy-go-lucky vampiress. The other play will take control of Mina, her more serious darkness-loving sister. Who will win this family feud?

This twisted rhythm game draws inspiration from argentinian game *La Gran Siete* by deliberately trying to make the player press the wrong key. Every now and then controls will switch between two layouts, will you be able to keep up?
